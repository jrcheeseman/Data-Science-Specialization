# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

run_analysis.R reads the relevant data files, makes them tidy, and outputs tidy_data.txt

CodeBook.md describes how the data were transformed, and basic details about the variables in tidy_data.txt
